# A game about the Deutsche Bahn

A godot game that originated at a game jam and is now in further development.

It will be relatable to anyone who has ever travelled in Germany, with the constant annoying train delays and ever-changing schedules.

This is a reverse tower defence game in which trains arrive in waves and you try to stop them from reaching their final station quickly. Players can place "delays" such as construction sites along branching tracks and trigger abilities such as people on the tracks to stall or reroute trains at just the right moment. The aim is to maximize the delay of all trains while at the same time not cause much train cancellations as this would lead to public discontent in the game.
